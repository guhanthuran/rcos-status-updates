## Last Week's Accomplishments

The LSTM I've been working on has come through to mostly being completed. I fixed the problem I had with Python and Keras/Tensorflow.
I am able to input poems but I am having trouble making the input trimmed and fit enough to look good for an output.
Right now the output is gibberish. Since the hardest part of Deep Learning is being able to properly making whatever you are inputting into data, this will be hard.

## This Week's Plan

Read the papers that got sent, and figure out how to make the input good enough so that the output of the Neural Net can look good enough to be an actual poem.
This way I can prepare myself for further Deep Learning statagem. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking as of yet.
