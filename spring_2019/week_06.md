## Last Week's Accomplishments

After I finished doing my LSTM, I started studying more about the difference between RNNs and CNNs.
My goal was to understand Neural Nets deeply so that I can decide what project I want to do that are related to music.
I've also looked into tone analyzers since I worked with that in Cognitive Computing, so with that knowledge I think I can apply that to this code.

## This Week's Plan

Try to get python working properly so that I can run my Tensorflow code through Wing.
Study more on NNs and read papers, and understand it more. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking as of yet.
