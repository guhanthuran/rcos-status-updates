## Last Week's Accomplishments

I prepared for the presentation by creating the powerpoint and putting what I did into it.
I also made my data fit the input for the Neural Net better, and the output looks a lot better than before.
I have accomplished my mission for now, so now I can use my knowledge to applying it to more musical concepts. 
I have started researching electronic music and how it can be analyzed and emulated. I think it would be cool for such a complex music genre to be created in such a way.

## This Week's Plan

Present the project and get my stuff on github. Then do more research on electronic music and hopefully be able to start making some data out of music.
Trasfiguring the music into data will take a while so I best start ASAP.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
