## Last Week's Accomplishments

Researched more on Electronic Music. The semester is winding down so I'm getting more time, I've just been reading a lot of papers on the subject.
This way I can prepare for the next semester and continue what I started in MxM.
I tried making a couple of scripts to break down electronic music into data but it is hard, I'll need more time to understand how NNs work for me to continue.

## This Week's Plan

Understand NNs better, and read more papers on it. As long as I continue to improve my understanding I can get further in my project in MxM. 

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.
