## Last Week's Accomplishments

I talked to Josh who helped me understand CNNs and RNNs a lot better, and sent me papers that I haven't looked at yet to help me further understand.
I also updated part of my LSTM and studied more about NNs. 
I also looked at different softwares like Audacity that also listen to music and tried unstanding how they worked so I can maybe apply that knowledge to my own code.

## This Week's Plan

Get TF working on my command line, since it is infinitely looping even though I reinstalled it through Anaconda.
Look at papers that I got sent.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking as of yet.
