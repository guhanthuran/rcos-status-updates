## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I read about RNNs and studied more about analyzing individual layers of a distribution in order to get our data.
I also got Tensorflow working on Wing but I want it working from command line since that would make it easier to run with different flags.

## This Week's Plan

Get Tensorflow working from commandline, and learn more about RNNs and how I can apply that to music based software.
I might be thinking of something related to synths since that I am most familiar with that kind of music.
I should also get some code uploaded to my git.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking as of yet.
